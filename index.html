          This article is a good read for people who are new to Set in
          JavaScript and are looking to find out how to use these new JavaScript
          methods. I'll highlight some advantages of using these methods with
          basic examples to show why you might reach for these instead of
          building your own implementations.
        </p>
        <h2>What's new in Set methods?</h2>
        <p>
          For those of you looking for the TL;DR, here's the gist of new methods
          that have cross-browser support:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>intersection()</code></a> returns a new set with
            elements in both this set and the given set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>union()</code></a
            >returns a new set with all elements in this set and the given set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>difference()</code></a> returns a new set with
            elements in this set but not in the given set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>symmetricDifference()</code></a
            >returns a new set with elements in either set, but not in both.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>isSubsetOf()</code></a
            >returns a boolean indicating if all elements of a set are in a
            specific set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>isSupersetOf()</code></a
            >returns a boolean indicating if all elements of a set are in a
            specific set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=""><code>isDisjointFrom()</code></a
            >returns a boolean indicating if this set has no elements in common
            with a specific set.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you've read (or skimmed) through the above list and are confused,
          don't worry, we'll describe what they do in the following sections.
          Each of these methods are used to check what the contents of sets are
          compared to the contents of another specific set.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a JavaScript Set?</h2>
        <p>
          A set is similar to an
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Array</a
          >, except that each value can only be stored once. <br />For example,
          we can take a list of items, add them all to a set, and then inspect
          the results of the set. <br /><br />The list on the right is the
          contents of the list on the left, but converted to a set. We have all
          duplicates removed from the list because we're guaranteed that a set
          is unique:
        </p>

        <img src="./Screenshot_0.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>
          This might not look like much in a small example such as this, but
          it's really convenient to have a built-in way to make unique
          collections of items, especially over larger data and more complex
          data types and objects. For example, consider that you can add
          elements to a set like so:
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          It's also typically faster to check if an element is in a set as
          opposed to in an Array, so this fits use cases where you need to keep
          an eye on performance in larger data sets. You can also compose new
          sets with specific logical properties based on existing sets, and
          we'll take a look at some examples of that below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll be covering all of the new methods below, but if you want to see
          everything you can do with a Set, check the Instance methods
          documentation.
        </p>
        <h2>Union of two sets</h2>
        <p>
          This is a good example to start us off if you're not familiar with
          sets. With the union, we can check what elements are in 'either or
          both' sets. In the example below, we have two lists and we want to
          make a third one that contains all items from both lists, but without
          duplicates:
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_2.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          We're using the HTML textContent of each list item so we have sets of
          strings, but you can see how this can be powerful if we consider that
          sets can contain data types like arrays or objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is helpful because we don't need any custom implementations to
          remove duplicates, do equality checks, or make other comparisons. Once
          we have elements in a set, we know they're all unique, and the union
          method is an optimized way to make a third set of (unique) items that
          appear in 'either or both' sets.
        </p>
        <h2>Set intersection</h2>
        <p>
          With set intersection, we can check what elements occur in both sets
          to see what the overlap is. In this example, instead of displaying the
          intersection set as a third list like we did with union above, we can
          use it to highlight elements that are 'both sets only':
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_3.jpg" alt="" />
        <h2>Set symmetric difference</h2>
        <p>
          Before we look at difference, let's look at symmetricDifference which
          might sound complex, but hopefully the example below demystifies that.
          What the symmetric difference does is lets us check which elements are
          in either set, but not both.
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_4.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          If this is all new and you're struggling to understand, compare the
          symmetric difference with the intersection example. You should see
          that the symmetricDifference method does the opposite logical
          operation of the intersection.
        </p>
        <h2>Set difference</h2>
        <p>
          With set difference, we can check which elements are in one set but
          not in another. For this example, we are creating two new sets instead
          of one. The first one (set1only) is created with set1.difference(set2)
          and what we get back is a new set of items that are 'set one only'. We
          do the same with the new set set2only to find items that are in set
          two but not in the first one. For each list, we can use the sets
          created with difference to highlight list items that don't appear in
          the other list.
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_5.jpg" alt="" />
        <h2>Subset, superset, and disjoint from</h2>
        <p>
          The last of the new methods and concepts that we can explore are
          subset, superset, and 'disjoint from' methods. By now, you're familiar
          with the set operations that return new sets. The subset, superset,
          and disjoint from methods don't return new sets, but a Boolean value
          to indicate certain state or logical checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first two we can look at are subset and superset. Instead of
          highlighting list items, we have some statements or assertions like
          "Set one is a subset of set two". We then add some text (TRUE / FALSE)
          to the list item depending on the result of a check like if
          (set1.isSupersetOf(set2)):
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_6.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          So with subset, we can check if all the items from a set appear in
          another set or not. With superset, we're doing the opposite, to see if
          a set has all items from another set, plus some additional items.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last method for us to look at is isDisjointFrom() where we can
          find out if two sets have no common elements. The first and second
          sets below are not disjoint from each other as they have one element
          ("C") in common. The third set is disjoint from the other two as it
          has no items in common with either set:
        </p>
        <img src="./Screenshot_7.jpg" alt="" />
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I hope you enjoyed this post about Set methods and why I think sets
          are an interesting concept to understand. Do you know different ways
          to use these methods in real-world examples? Feel free to get in touch
          with us and let me know what you think or if I've missed something!
          You should be all Set for your next project, so see you next time!
